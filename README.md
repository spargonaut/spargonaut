## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Spargonaut.  
I'm a polyglot software engineer.  
I've been writing software professionally since 2010.  
I've been playing with, and working with computers since the late 1990s.

- Iâ€™m currently working on an application to track data on my Hydroponic Farmstand
- Iâ€™m currently learning rust and Go
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my CLI tool [custom_commands](https://github.com/the-lazy-devs/custom_commands)  
  Its a tool used to create shortcuts from long, cumbersome commands, and easily share them across multiple machines.
- Ask me about whatever is on your mind.  :)
- Fun fact:  The past few years I've been getting into Indoor Hydroponic Gardening and really enjoying it!

This github profile is my personal profile, and is just one of my repository profiles.  
you can also find some of my work on my [gitlab profile](https://gitlab.com/Spargonaut) where I keep some of my other
projects.  

I keep separate profiles for my professional work based on the tools being used.  
My current work profile is [spargo-nv](https://github.com/spargo-nv).
You can see my activity over there,  but all of the repos I work in over there are private.
